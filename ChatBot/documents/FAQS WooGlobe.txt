Licensing and Contracts
         11.  What does it mean to license my video to WooGlobe?
Licensing a video to WooGlobe means granting them the rights to use, distribute, and monetize your content on various platforms. This agreement allows WooGlobe to act as an intermediary, promoting and selling your video to media outlets, TV shows, social media channels, and other potential buyers. In return, you typically receive a share of the revenue generated from these licensing deals.
When you license your video, you usually retain ownership of the content while WooGlobe handles the marketing, sales, unauthorized usage of your content and distribution efforts. The licensing can be exclusive, where WooGlobe has sole rights to monetize the video, or sell the video further to any media outlets, TV shows, social media channels, and other potential buyers. The agreement also defines terms for social media usage, payment, and termination, providing a structured way to maximize the reach and earning potential of your video.
for further assistance we can visit to the following link: https://wooglobe.com/terms 
         12. Is the licensing agreement exclusive and explain what an exclusive contract is?
An exclusive agreement with WooGlobe means that you grant them the sole rights to license, distribute, and monetize your video, preventing you from licensing it to other platforms or companies. Under this arrangement, WooGlobe exclusively manages all aspects of monetization, including promoting the video to media outlets, TV shows, and social media channels, in exchange for a share of the revenue generated. This can increase the video’s chances of being widely distributed and monetized, as WooGlobe focuses its efforts on maximizing its reach and profitability.
We only work with exclusive agreements and there are a couple of very good reasons for that
a) Buyers often undercut pricing when video is non-exclusively licensed. With exclusive licensing, we can secure the highest price for your video (on average 3x-5x times higher than non-exclusive agreements) through our extensive experience in the media and ads industry.
b) We also require an exclusive license for copyright protection of the video. The copyright protection is offered free of charge to you and is required for claiming revenues from unauthorized use of your video. This is a significant amount and could equate to thousands of dollars over time. Without an exclusive deal, we cannot deploy these proprietary tools for claiming revenues from unauthorized use.
            13. How long does the licensing agreement last?
The licensing agreement with WooGlobe is perpetual, meaning it doesn't have an expiration date and continues indefinitely. By choosing a perpetual agreement, you grant WooGlobe the rights to license, distribute, and monetize your video for as long as you wish. This allows us to keep working on maximizing the video's exposure and revenue potential over time. If you ever decide you want to end the agreement, you can reach out to us, and we can discuss the termination terms outlined in the contract.
            14. What happens if I want to cancel my agreement with WooGlobe?
If you want to cancel your agreement with WooGlobe, you may request termination after one year. However, WooGlobe reserves the right to approve or deny this request. If the agreement is canceled, any licenses granted before termination will remain valid, meaning WooGlobe and its partners can continue to use your video under previously granted licenses. Termination does not affect ongoing deals made before the cancellation request.
            15. Can I license my video to other companies while it is with WooGlobe?
No, you cannot license your video to other companies while it is with WooGlobe due to the exclusive agreement. However, if another company approaches you for licensing your video, you can refer them to WooGlobe by directing them to contact licensing@wooglobe.com. WooGlobe will handle the negotiations and ensure you get the best possible deal while maintaining the integrity of the exclusive contract. This process ensures all licensing and monetization goes through WooGlobe, maximizing your revenue opportunities.
            16. Can I upload my video to social media while it is licensed to WooGlobe?
Yes, you can upload your video to social media while it is licensed to WooGlobe. However, since WooGlobe holds the exclusive rights to monetize and distribute the video commercially, you must include a statement in your social media posts such as: "For licensing or usage, contact licensing@wooglobe.com." This allows WooGlobe to handle any commercial inquiries while you maintain personal use and sharing of your video on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok.
            17. What happens if my video is already available on YouTube or another platform?
If your video is already available on YouTube or another platform, WooGlobe will manage the commercial rights and monetization while ensuring your personal channel remains unaffected. We partner with YouTube CRM and use YouTube ContentID to protect your video from unauthorized use. We will whitelist your channels, so no issues arise with your own uploads. If someone else uses your video without permission, WooGlobe will manage and enforce the rights and claim it  accordingly, ensuring you receive the proper revenue and protection.
            18. Will WooGlobe own my video?
No, WooGlobe will not own your video. You retain full ownership and copyright of the video. However, by entering into an agreement with WooGlobe, you grant us exclusive rights to license, distribute, and monetize the video. This allows WooGlobe to handle all commercial activities related to your video while you remain the legal owner, ensuring your video is protected and used in accordance with the licensing terms.
            19. What are my responsibilities as a video owner under this agreement?
As a video owner under the agreement with WooGlobe, your responsibilities include:
               1. Ownership Verification: Ensure you own full rights to the video and any people featured have granted permission for its use.
               2. Compliance: Your video must comply with all legal requirements and not infringe on any third-party rights.
               3. Video Quality: Submit the best quality version of your video.
               4. Exclusive Rights: Grant WooGlobe exclusive rights to license and distribute, so that we can generate the sales against your video.
               5. Maintain Integrity: Comply with all terms of the WooGlobe agreement and provide accurate information.
This ensures smooth licensing and revenue generation.
               20. What happens if there is a legal issue with my video?
WooGlobe handles legal matters related to the licensing and distribution of your video. However, as the video owner, you are responsible for ensuring that you have obtained all necessary permissions to avoid legal issues, such as copyright or privacy violations. If there are claims related to third-party rights, copyright, or unauthorized use, WooGlobe will assist in resolving these matters, but it is your responsibility to ensure the video complies with legal standards before submission.
               21. How does WooGlobe protect my video from unauthorized use?
WooGlobe not only protects your video on YouTube through ContentID but also safeguards your rights across all platforms. If someone uses your video without authorization or consent on any platform, WooGlobe will take action against those accounts, ensuring that the videos are either taken down or claimed for revenue. WooGlobe handles all the necessary legal and administrative processes to protect your content from unauthorized use, ensuring you maintain control and benefit from your video across platforms.
               22. Why do you need my friend approval because I have raw file and he/she recorded it on  my phone
We also need approval from the person who recorded the video to complete the permission process. It's just that some of the high paying multinational clients require additional permission from the person who was holding the camera.
                  23. How do I know if this is legit ? / I don't trust you
Well, happy to address these concerns. We have been operating behind the scenes for years and providing content to the most prominent international media and produced around the world. You can check out our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/wooglobe and TikTok channel to get some idea https://www.tiktok.com/@wooglobe

                  24. What's the duration of the Agreement?
The duration of the agreement is perpetual.
                  25. I'm not interested in exclusive agreements!
First of all try to clarify WHY the person is not interested in an exclusive contract. Use questions like :
If you don't mind me asking, what is your concern with exclusive contracts ?
We only work with exclusive agreements and there are a couple of very good reasons for that
a) Buyers often undercut pricing when video is non-exclusively licensed. With exclusive licensing, we can secure the highest price for your video (on average 3x-5x times higher than non-exclusive agreements) through our extensive experience in the media and ads industry.
b) We also require an exclusive license for copyright protection of the video. The copyright protection is offered free of charge to you and is required for claiming revenues from unauthorized use of your video. This is a significant amount and could equate to thousands of dollars over time. Without an exclusive deal, we cannot deploy these proprietary tools for claiming revenues from unauthorized use.
                     26.  I don't want to license my video because I don't need money / This video is not for sale ?
That is absolutely fine. In that case, would it be OK for us to share it on our social channels and through our partner network ? If yes, appreciate it if you could upload the video on this form and provide us formal approval for sharing ?
https://www.wooglobe.com/video-submission/revshare60


                     27. Why don't you buy this from me?
If we buy it from you, you will get a one off payment but you will lose the ownership and copyrights of the video. Secondly, if you sell the video now you will get only a minimal price for the video and you wont realize its full potential. By licensing, you will get the 60% revenues for all future earnings which is more often than not, significant over the years. This is the reason 99.9% of the video owners prefer to license it. Please keep in mind that with our licensing model, you retain the ownership and copyrights to the video.
                     28. I asked my friend if he has not had good experience with licensing his videos, so I’m not interested.
Hmmm. Well I can't comment on your friend’s experience as it may have been with a different agency and I don't know how much potential was there in the video.
I can only tell you that we only work with highly selective videos where we see the video has good potential to earn money. Plus we are the biggest distributor in the viral video space. We have 6000+ clients including large TV channels, media agencies, newspapers and producers. This means your video has a much higher chance of sales and generating income for you. 
                     29. Do you have a list of the clients?
We have 7000+ clients in News, Media, Advertising and Social media space through direct and indirect partnerships. Some of the well known clients' names include MTV, BBC, CNN, Comedy Central, Dailymail, NBC, ABC, MSN, Yahoo, Ladbible, The Sun, MailOnline, Discovery, RightThisMinute etc.


Payment and Revenue
                     30. How much revenue will I receive from my video?
The revenue you receive from your video on WooGlobe is based on a revenue share model where you typically earn 60% of the revenue generated from your content, with the remainder going to WooGlobe. Your earnings are directly tied to the performance of your video, including factors like sales and the video usage.

                     34. Can I negotiate a higher revenue share?
Certainly! Negotiating revenue shares is a common consideration, especially when it comes to valuable content. However, in the standard arrangement, WooGlobe offers a competitive 60% revenue share for video owners. This percentage is typically non-negotiable.
If you believe your video holds exceptional value or has unique market potential, we recommend discussing your specific case with your WooGlobe representative. They can provide insights and explore any possible adjustments based on the video’s merits.
                     35. Will WooGlobe provide me with an upfront payment?

                     37. What if my video doesn’t generate any revenue?
If your video does not generate sales, you will not receive payments, as WooGlobe cannot create revenue from non-performing content. However, rest assured that WooGlobe is committed to supporting you by actively promoting all videos to enhance their visibility and increase their revenue potential.
                     38. Can I receive payments in a currency other than USD?

As a video creator, you will earn 60% of the revenue generated from your content, with no upfront costs or deductions. WooGlobe is dedicated to maximizing your long-term earning potential, with no unexpected charges or complicated terms—just a clear and direct partnership.
                     40. Why is the 60/40% Revenue Share Policy is not mentioned in the submission form?
It will be mentioned in the final agreement. The reason it's not mentioned in general T&Cs is that the percentage may vary. In this case, we can offer 60/40 but rest assured it will be mentioned in the contract.
                     41. How do I know I will get paid ?
All sales are online and tracked on our online portal. You can see the performance and sales data of the video in your online account. You will get access to it once you sign-up with us.
                     42. How will you pay me ? / What payment method do you use ? / I don't have Paypal.
We can pay via PayPal or directly in your bank account through wire transfer. If you don’t have PayPal, we can always do a wire transfer to your bank account.
                     43. Do you send legal invoices for the payments? As we would like to receive them in our bank account, but without the legal documentation, that would be a problem for us. We do have a VAT number because I assume your company base isn't in Spain.
We can provide invoice upon request - once you receive the payments, you can email accounts@wooglobe.com request for invoices / remittance advice. We are registered in the UK, for all other countries we pay No-VAT invoices as for us VAT is only applicable in the UK.
                        44. How much does your service cost?
It’s absolutely free, there is no charge whatsoever. In fact we are the ones who are going to pay you (60% revenues) from what your video generates.
                        45. How much do you think this video could earn in a month ?
It’s a bit hard to predict as it depends on a number of factors. However we only work with highly selective videos that have good potential. On average, each sale is between $250 - $750 and there are multiple sales per video. Some of our videos have earned as high as $40,000 over the year
                        46. I will only get 60% ? 60% is too low 
There are significant costs involved to generate sales. The 40% share we keep is used to cover our expenses (marketing / promotion, content protection, copyrighting, third party dispute handling, payment etc). Other companies typically only pay 50%. We are also the biggest distributors of viral videos. If you look at it in absolute terms, our 60% is greater than others 70% or even 80/90% as we generate higher sales volume and value of the deals.
If the video is good, we can alway increase the percentage to 65% or 70% (If there is competition from others)
                           47.  Can you give me guarantee that I would be paid for this? 
We can give you guarantee that if the video sells then you will be paid for it. However we cannot guarantee that that video will sell, unfortunately this is the nature of the industry as the sale depends on a number of factors. e.g. we have a video that didn't sell for one year but in the next year did sales of $12,000. Having said that, it's in our interest to sell the video as we also only make money if the video sells. So we try our best to sell ASAP and at the highest price point possible.
                           48.  Would I get a tax form after a certain amount of payment / revenue?
We do not provide a Tax form or deduct any taxes from income generated by the video. The tax obligations of every person are different and hence we are not in a position to . As per our contract, the customers are responsible for their tax filing and returns as per their personal circumstances.

There is no fixed timeline for when your video will start generating revenue. It depends on how quickly media partners or clients express interest and purchase the rights to use your video.

WooGlobe works continuously to market your video to its network, but the timing of revenue generation can vary based on demand and interest from clients.

Yes, WooGlobe may promote your video on its social media channels and with media partners to maximize exposure.
                                 56. Can I choose which platforms my video is distributed on?
No, as part of the agreement with WooGlobe, you cannot choose specific platforms for distribution. WooGlobe manages the licensing and distribution of your video across its wide network of clients, including TV channels, media outlets, advertisers, and social media platforms. This broad approach maximizes exposure and revenue potential for your video. However, WooGlobe ensures your video is only used in appropriate and commercially viable contexts as per the terms of the agreement.
                                 57. We found our video on youtube with your own name on it on your channel ?
The video is posted on WooGlobe’s YouTube account as a 'display reel’ or "showreel" that we often send out to TV Channel and Media Partners. The WooGlobe channel is also used as our hosting archive from which our clients often choose videos for purchase. Not having your video displayed on the channel means your video will not be advertised to the media partners and hence won’t be available for sale. Hence the reason we display all our content on the WooGlobe YouTube channel. Also please note this is inline with Clause (2) of the WooGlobe licensing agreement.
                                 58.  I don't want to restrict anyone else from sharing my video with credit.
This shouldn't be a problem when licensing with us. We work with many video owners on this concept. If this is a model you choose, we allow non-commercial users to share your video free of cost (to provide exposure to you) and the commercial users to pay for use. Our licensing team can differentiate these requests and allocate permissions accordingly.
                                 59. Can I still sell my video to news agencies after licensing my video ? If not, then I'm not interested.
The short answer is no, however you will be better off financially if you get it licensed / sold through us as we will be able to negotiate the best price for it.
To explain further, the video price depends on a number of factors such as license type (e.g. Editorial, Digital, OTT, Broadcast, Web, Social, Commercial etc) , Geographies for use, Licensing duration, rights required, indemnification requirements etc. The price range varies SIGNIFICANTLY depending on the usage type. Due to these complexities, the video owners when negotiating directly often leave money on the table or price it too high and lose the deal. We have a specialist team, with years of industry experience who can negotiate the optimal price of the video. 
                                    60. I have other pages that just like to share the video for positivity. Are they no longer allowed to do this if I sign? 
We can help you do that and at the same time help you earn money from commercial licensing. All we request you to do is pass on sharing requests to Licensing@WooGlobe.com. In such cases, we allow non-commercial on pages free of charge; this way the video and positivity spreads unhindered. For commercial partners, we request them to pay for commercial use. So it's a win-win situation for you.
                                    61. Has anything happened with my video (any query or sale opportunity) as I signed up with WooGlobe?
I guess the best way is to check the video performance on the online portal or you can email viral@wooglobe.com. We get usage / sales reports from our partners towards the mid of the month and this is when the data is updated on the portal.
                                    62. After licensing can I still monetize where my video is currently posted?
Yes, you can continue to monetise your channel and video on YouTube. After licensing the video, please drop us an email on viral@wooglobe.com we will make sure everything is in order to allow you to monetise your video
                                    63. How will my video be used ?
We have 6000+ clients in the News, Media, Advertising and Social media space who use content in various creative but positive ways.
News related material >>> Used by News Channels, Online News.
Story Based Content >>> Media Companies, Social Media Account, TV Channels, Ads agencies.
Trending / Emotional / Touching / Funny Clips >>> TV Programs , Social Media, Ads.
General Viral Content >>> TV Programs , Social Media, Ads.
We also monitor any unauthorized use of the content on YouTube and we can claim monetisation through specialist tools we have access to.
                                       64. Customer : I am sorry, I submit only videos to clients that offer confirmed usage and an outright amount 
No, we cannot guarantee a confirmed usage or an outright amount. Unfortunately, that is not how the industry works.

Let me explain.
When we engage with the TV shows, Ads agencies and media companies - we pitch them with ‘cleared content' i.e. that is videos that are already signed.  Given the fast pace of the work and certainty required on content, we cannot and do not pitch content that is not signed already. It doesn’t help anyone involved in the process. (Sometimes the request comes at 1-hour notice and it's impossible to secure rights in that time period.)
The pitched content is then scheduled for the programmes/ads etc and often goes through various edits and cuts. The final confirmation of sale only comes after the use of the video.  This is how the industry and our 7000+ clients work and this includes the Viacoms, BBCs, Universal Studios of the world !
I understand you have a different view and that is perfectly fine. Unfortunately, that is not compatible with the ways of working in the industry.

Yes, your video is protected by copyright the moment you create it. As the original creator, you automatically own the rights to the video.

This includes obtaining consent from all individuals whose faces, voices, or personal information are identifiable in the video.

These tools monitor unauthorized uses of your video across both platforms.

                                                90. Why do you need my personal info (Home address etc.) ?

                                                91. I have already given you a video 2, 3, 4 etc. months ago but still I didn’t get anything from you guys. So I’m not interested to give you to my other video
I understand that the video hasn't generated sales yet. It’s not that the older video doesn't have potential, it's just that sometimes it takes a bit longer for the right opportunity to come and for the sales to happen. We have numerous cases where a video did nothing in the first year but then had sales of five figures in just 3-4 months.
