WooGlobe Q&A Reference Guide

Generated on 2025-06-27
Q1: Do you have a LLC of some sort?
Yes—WooGlobe is a legally registered media company operating for over six years, serving over 7,000 media clients globally.
Q2: Why would I give you my viral video with a link to submit it first?
Submitting your original file lets us secure the highest-quality version for licensing. We pitch it to top outlets (BBC, CNN, LadBible, etc.)—not just repost.
Q3: So how does this give me credit when I give you the original footage?
We always credit the creator in our descriptions. On our official channels you’ll see your handle whenever we post your video.
Q4: How does your pay cumulate? Is it by the views? If so, how much do y’all pay through views?
We pay via licensing revenue, not per view. You earn 60% of each sale, and a single sale typically ranges $250–$750.
Q5: What is the expected time frame for a payout? Is it once after x amount of time or every week/month?
We pay quarterly on the 15th, provided your earnings exceed the £70 threshold. You’ll see payouts logged in your portal.
Q6: Is there a way you can prove you really work for WooGlobe?
Yes—our official WooGlobe social profiles follow our researcher accounts, and we can send a verification email from our @wooglobe.com domain.
Q7: Cant you send me a dm on TikTok through the official WooGlobe account?
Our official account is reserved for content; outreach is handled by our research profile. You can verify by checking the follower list.
Q8: Not really because I don’t know if you're real and that video isn’t viral at all.
WooGlobe works behind the scenes on licensing; virality doesn’t matter—we focus on licensing potential. We’ve placed videos with major networks.
Q9: What’s so interesting about my video?
Our clients look for compelling, time‑sensitive, or heartwarming content—your video fits a current demand for [topic/event].
Q10: Is this a trusted news agency?
Yes, we license content to globally trusted outlets like BBC, CNN, Reuters, and Daily Mail via our vetted network.
Q11: Sorry. Reviews are shady. I’ll skip on the opportunity.
Some negative reviews online are fake competitor posts. We have countless success stories—one video generated $40K over its lifetime.
Q12: Seems like too much work.
It’s just a one‑time upload—after that, we handle everything: pitching, negotiation, and payment tracking.
Q13: Is this legit?
Absolutely—we’ve operated for over six years, licensing to major TV and digital platforms worldwide.
Q14: Hope it will not be shown as a joke. Also how can I guarantee payment?
Our contracts include usage clauses preventing derogatory edits, and payments are guaranteed via our portal once a sale is logged.
Q15: How does this work and how is revenue tracked?
Once you upload, we pitch to clients. Sales show up in your personal portal in real time, and your 60% share is logged automatically.
Q16: Why would I agree to these terms without a guarantee of compensation?
While we can’t guarantee every video will sell immediately, our model has helped creators earn hundreds to thousands over time.

60/40 split—60% to you, 40% to WooGlobe to cover marketing, admin, and distribution costs.
Q18: Can I see the portal first before submitting the video?
The portal is generated per video after upload to ensure accurate tracking. You’ll receive access via email in 24–48 hours.
Q19: How is the revenue share calculated?
Calculated on gross licensing fees per sale: you receive 60% of each deal’s value.
Q20: Do you offer pay in advance?
No, we focus on revenue share to maximize your lifetime earnings rather than a one‑time small advance.
Q21: I have sent my videos to agencies and never got paid.
WooGlobe uses formal contracts and a transparent portal—competitors may have untrustworthy processes, but our track record is proven.
Q22: Is it necessary to get the recorder's permission?
Yes, some clients require written consent from the camera operator to clear rights, especially for high‑value broadcasts.
Q23: When do we need to provide payment details?
Once your video logs its first sale, our production team will reach out to collect your preferred payout info.
Q24: I’m sorry but all this is a little too fishy. Can you buy it instead?
We operate on licensing, not buying. This model often outperforms a one‑time buyout by allowing ongoing revenue.

After upload, you’ll receive a formal contract by email specifying terms, splits, and usage rights.

On average, $250–$750 per sale, with many videos selling multiple times—some have earned over $40,000.

Not required, but the more you submit, the greater your chances of multiple sales.
Q48: Can I still work with other companies?
