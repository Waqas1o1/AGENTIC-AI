Why should I monetize my video on YouTube through WooGlobe and not do it myself?
Ans. YouTube has made YouTube monetization extremely hard for normal users. Although you can monetize your videos on YouTube yourself however you need approval for video monetization, a process that is highly tedious and could take years. This is because of two main reasons.
• Highly Strict YouTube Monetization Rules : As per the newly introduced rules by YouTube in Jan 2018, a user cannot monetize videos on YouTube unless he/she has at least 1000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time in the past 12 months. Both these conditions must be fulfilled before the user can even apply for monetization. The application itself takes a couple of months for approval. For a typical YouTube user, its extremely hard to qualify under this criteria or at best, it could take months / years before a user qualifies for monetization on YouTube.
• Absence of Large and Relevant Subscriber base : Once the user has qualified for monetization, the YouTube only pays the user once the earning has exceeded USD 100. Generating an ad revenue of USD 100 often requires highly relevant and large subscriber base (typically 10,000+) that can generate required number of views for the video. This is something very hard to get for a typical YouTube user. Because of (a) and (b), it’s hard for a normal YouTube user to generate any meaningful income from the videos.

How much will I make from the video?
Ans. The short answer is, it’s very hard to predict and we cannot guarantee anything. Every video content is unique and there are number of factors involved in monetization of a video.
On YouTube, the videos are evaluated on the following main factors; video content, geographic location of the audience, device being used to view the video, and length of the video. In the video licensing, the length of the license period, and media on which it will be played/ used determines the expected revenue. Because of these complex factors, it’s extremely hard to assess or guarantee how much a video would make.
On a positive note, our teams are working round the clock to monetize your content because if you make money, only then we will get paid our share.
